Description

A strings comprised of digits from 0 to 9 contains a perfect substring if all the elements within a substring occur exactly k times. Calculate the number of perfect substrings in s.

Example

s = 1102021222

k = 2

The6perfect substrings are:

s[0:1] = 11
s[0:5] = 110202
s[1:6] = 102021
s[2:5] = 0202
s[7:8] = 22
s[8:9] = 22

Input
str s: a string where the value of each elements[i]is described by the character at positioni(where 0 ≤ i < n)

int k: an integer that denotes the required frequency of the substring

1≤ sizeof(s) ≤ 10^5

0≤ s[i]≤ 9 (where 0 ≤ i < n)

1≤ k ≤ 10^5

STDIN         Function
-----         --------
1020122   →   s = '1020122' 
2         →   k = 2

Output
int:an integer that represents the number of perfect substrings in the given string
